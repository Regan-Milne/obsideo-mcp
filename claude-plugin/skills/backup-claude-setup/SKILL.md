# Back up a Claude Code setup

A project's Claude Code configuration is real work — a `CLAUDE.md` that took months to
get right, custom skills, agents, hooks. It usually lives in one directory on one
machine, and often isn't committed. This backs it up offsite, encrypted.

## Step 1 — find what's there, and show the user

Look for, relative to the project root:

- `CLAUDE.md`, and any nested `CLAUDE.md` files
- `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/hooks/`
- `.claude/settings.json`

List what you actually found, with sizes. Do not guess at the layout; check.

## Step 2 — exclude credentials, and say that you did

**Never include these unless the user reads the file and explicitly says to:**

| Path | Why |
|---|---|
| `.mcp.json` | `env` blocks routinely hold API keys |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | personal overrides, often with tokens |
| `.env`, `.env.*` | secrets by definition |
| `*.pem`, `*.key`, `id_*`, `*_token*`, `credentials*` | key material |

State plainly which files you left out and why. If the user wants `.mcp.json`
included, open it first, show them the `env` blocks, and let them decide with the
values in front of them.

This matters more than it looks: the archive gets encrypted, but it is still an
archive you are creating from their disk. Do not put a key in it by accident.

## Step 3 — archive and upload

Build one archive so the setup restores as a unit:

```
tar -czf claude-setup-<project>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.tar.gz <the paths from step 1>
```

Then `put` it under a stable key such as `claude-setup/<project>/<date>.tar.gz`.
It is encrypted on this machine before upload; the key stays in `~/.obsideo`.

If no Obsideo account is configured, `put` creates a free trial (100 MB, about a
week, no email). A Claude Code setup is normally a few hundred KB, so the free tier
is not a constraint here. Say that the trial was created rather than letting it
happen silently.

## Step 4 — make the backup real

Two things, both quick, and neither is optional:

1. `verify` the object. Report it as **n of 3 providers proved possession**.
2. Call `backup_keys` and have the user store the result somewhere other than this
   machine. An encrypted archive plus a lost key is not a backup.

## Restoring

`get` the object to a path the user names, then `tar -xzf` it. Tell them to review
`settings.json` before trusting it on a different machine, and remind them the
excluded credential files are not in the archive and will need to be recreated.

## Keeping it current

A setup backup is worth repeating after meaningful changes, not on a timer. Offer to
re-run this after the user adds a skill or reworks `CLAUDE.md`; uploading the same
unchanged archive daily wastes their quota and tells them nothing.
